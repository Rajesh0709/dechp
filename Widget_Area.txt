 Create Widget Area:

Step 1 add code in to your theme:

The first step is to add the following line of code to the part of your theme that you want to widgetize. Be sure to change “Name of Widgetized Area” to a name that makes sense for you


<?php if ( !function_exists('dynamic_sidebar') || !dynamic_sidebar("Name of Widgetized Area") ) : ?>
<?php endif;?>



Step 2: Edit functions.php


if ( function_exists('register_sidebar') )
  register_sidebar(array(
    'name' => 'Name of Widgetized Area',
    'before_widget' => '<div class = "widgetizedArea">',
    'after_widget' => '</div>',
    'before_title' => '<h3>',
    'after_title' => '</h3>',
  )
);
